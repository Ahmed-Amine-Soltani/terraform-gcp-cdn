This module allow you to host a static website on Cloud Storage bucket for a domain you own behind a CDN on [Google Cloud Platform Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs)



The ressources that will be created in your project:

- An external IP address  [link](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/compute_global_address) [link](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/ip-addresses/reserve-static-external-ip-address#reserve_new_static)

- An entry in Cloud DNS to map the IP address to the domain name [link](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/dns_record_set) [link](https://cloud.google.com/dns/docs/tutorials/create-domain-tutorial#set-up-domain)

    google-beta = {
      source  = "hashicorp/google-beta"
      version = "~> 3.52.0"
    }
  }
}

# GCP provider
provider "google" {
  credentials = file(var.key)
  project     = var.google_project
  region      = var.region
  zone        = var.zone
}
