- An external IP address  [link](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/compute_global_address) [link](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/ip-addresses/reserve-static-external-ip-address#reserve_new_static)

- An entry in Cloud DNS to map the IP address to the domain name [link](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/dns_record_set) [link](https://cloud.google.com/dns/docs/tutorials/create-domain-tutorial#set-up-domain)
- A GCS bucket [link](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/storage_bucket) [link](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/hosting-static-website)
- A https external load balancer with CDN  [link](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/compute_global_forwarding_rule) [link](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/https) 
- A http external load balancer to redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS [link]()  [link](https://cloud.google.com/cdn/docs/setting-up-http-https-redirect#partial-http-lb)
- A managed certificate for HTTPS [link](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/compute_managed_ssl_certificate) [link](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/ssl-certificates/google-managed-certs)





#### Usage

You can go to the examples folder, however the usage of the module could be like this in your own main.tf file:

```hcl
module "cdn" {
  source  = "Ahmed-Amine-Soltani/cdn/gcp"
  version = "1.0.0"
  dns_name                     = "example"
  google_dns_managed_zone_name = "my-google-dns-managed-zone-name"
  google_storage_bucket_name   = "example.bucket.mydnsname.com"
}
```



Then perform the following commands on the root folder:

- `terraform init` to get the plugins

- `terraform plan` to see the infrastructure plan

- `terraform apply` to apply the infrastructure build

- `terraform destroy` to destroy the built infrastructure
